# Provisioning-EC2-Instances-Using-AWS-CLI

Hey there! This is the code repository for my AWS EC2 provisioning. In this repo, you'll find all the code I used to provision my EC2 instance. I'll be updating this README with more information soon, but in the meantime, feel free to explore the code and see how everything works. Thanks for stopping by!

I created this VPC and subnets all on my own - you can check out how I did that by clicking on the link above.

Note: I created the VPC and subnets earlier. You can access the VPC and subnets code using this link.
